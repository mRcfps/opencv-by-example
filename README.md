# OpenCV by Example

Code samples from the Packt book *OpenCV by Example* (2016).

## How to run

Make sure you have [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) installed. Each directory under the chapter directory is a standalone [CMake](https://cmake.org/) project. Enter one project and run following commands:

```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. && make
```
